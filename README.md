[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/landscape-management-sample-scripts)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/landscape-management-sample-scripts)

## Description
SAP Landscape Management (LaMa) is an orchestration solution to simplify, automate, and centralize the management and operations of your SAP landscapes running on premise, in the public or private cloud, or in hybrid environments. Within this repository, SAP, partners, and customers share sample scripts around automation of their SAP landscapes. 

### SAP Landscape Management, enterprise edition
Most of the samples are related to **SAP Landscape Management, enterprise edition** in combination with other tools. It is irrelevant if these scripts run inside the [Automation Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_LANDSCAPE_MANAGEMENT_ENTERPRISE/e7dead4286c545808b3bd24feee7448c/110cb37a716946bcbd65eed9740bc9db.html?locale=en-US) or if they run outside of SAP Landscape Management and make use of [its API](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPLandscapeManagement/overview).

Other sample scripts for Automation Studio are included in various blogs that are listed in the link below. It is recommended that any future blog related to Automation Studio should host the sample scripts in GitHub and linked from the blogs.

#### Custom Operations

See different types of custom operations which were requested by customer implementation services.

Most of those custom operations are executable standalone. Some are only executable in the context of another (custom) process.

### SAP Landscape Management Cloud
With the introduction of public REST APIs and events inside **SAP Landscape Management Cloud**, there will be more and more examples on combining this cloud solution with external services like SAP Event Mesh, SAP BTP runtimes, or 3rd party tools.

As [REST APIs](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPLandscapeManagementCloud/overview) and [events](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPLandscapeManagementCloudBusinessEvents/overview) are newly introduced to SAP Landscape Management Cloud, please provide us with feedback and expectations towards future endpoints and events via the [discussions](https://github.com/SAP-samples/landscape-management-sample-scripts/discussions).
